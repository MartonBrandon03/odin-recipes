    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef bourguignon (a.k.a. beef Burgundy) is a French beef stew braised in red wine and beef broth. It also prominently features onions, carrots, and mushrooms.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wine:</strong> For true beef bourguignon, you'll need a red Burgundy wine that is produced in the Burgundy region of eastern France with Pinot Noir grapes. Quality counts.</li>
      <li><strong>Brandy:</strong> Cognac brandy enhances the overall flavor of this complex dish.</li>
      <li><strong>Fresh</strong> and <strong>canned vegetables:</strong> You'll need fresh onions, carrots, and mushrooms. You'll also need a can of tomato paste.</li>
      <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> You'll need olive oil for browning the beef and sauteing the mushrooms.</li>
      <li><strong>Spices</strong> and <strong>seasonings:</strong> This traditional beef bourguignon is seasoned with parsley, a bay leaf, garlic, black peppercorns, garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This beef bourguignon recipe calls for two pounds of cubed beef chuck roast.</li>
      <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> Bacon adds even more meaty flavor to this irresistible beef bourguignon.</li>
      <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps thicken the bourguignon mixture.</li>
      <li><strong>Broth:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade beef broth.</li>
      <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Sauté the mushrooms in butter before adding them to the meat mixture.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start marinating the meat two days in advance. Chill in the fridge.</li>
      <li>Brown the beef in olive oil until browned on all sides, then transfer to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Sauté the bacon in the same skillet, then move the bacon to the beef bowl.</li>
      <li>Deglaze the skillet with a cup of the marinade.</li>
      <li>Sauté the onions and carrots. Move the veggies to the bowl with the meat.</li>
      <li>Add the flour to the skillet and stir until brown.</li>
      <li>Add the tomato paste, garlic, broth, marinade, and salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Whisk until smooth, then transfer to the bowl with the meat and veggies.</li>
      <li>Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and bake for three hours.</li>
      <li>Sauté the mushrooms, then stir the mushrooms into the bourguignon.</li>
      <h3>What to serve with</h3>
      <p>Ladle the beef bourguignon over rice, mashed potatoes, or egg noodles. That's certainly a very filling meal in and of itself, so you don't technically need to add any sides. Of course, a nice loaf of crusty French bread is essential to soak up all that beefy goodness.</p>
